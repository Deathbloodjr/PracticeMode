 A mod to enter a practice mode in TDMX.

 This mod was made to resemble a lot of the features from Taiko PS4's practice mode. This mod's able to adjust the song speed from 1.0x down to 0.5x, as well as scroll forward or backward in a song. \

 I was unable to get branch changes working though, so this mod might not work properly on songs with branches. I'm not sure exactly how it'll look on songs with branches. It might auto force you to normal branch every time you scroll. \
 
 
# Usage
 After installation, you can enter Practice Mode by going to the Custom Modes button at the right, and selecting Practice Mode. 
 This will bring you to a slightly modified song select menu. Select your desired song and course, and you'll enter a modified enso mode. 
 In this mode, you can pause the game by hitting the pause button (escape on keyboard). This won't bring up the typical pause menu, but you'll see the notes stop moving. 
 In this state, you can hit up or down to adjust the song speed by 0.05x intervals, ranging from 1.0x to 0.5x. You can also hit left or right to scroll the song left or right. Double tapping left or right will scroll 10x faster, to help you get to where you want to be in the song faster. 
 If you then hit the pause button a second time, you'll see the typical pause menu working as intended. 
 Finally, when you reach the end of the song, you won't see a results screen. The game will just pause again, allowing you to rewind to practice further, or return to the practice mode song select menu.
